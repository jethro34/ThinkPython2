# Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following methods:
# 1. An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an empty list.
# 2. A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds it to pouch_contents.
# 3. A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object and the contents of the pouch.
# Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables named kanga and roo,
# and then adding roo to the contents of kangaâ€™s pouch.
